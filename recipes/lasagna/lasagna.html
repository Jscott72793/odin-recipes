    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd-cottage cheese
        and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
